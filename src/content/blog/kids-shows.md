As a parent of a young child whom I'm raising bilingual, I'm always on the lookout for kids shows in Spanish on YouTube that my daughter can watch. This is a short list of shows or channels I've found in the last 2 years for here. Most are native-content (made for native Spanish speakers) but some are dubbed. Enjoy!

## Shows for Kids in Spanish on YouTube

- [Blippi Espa√±ol](https://www.youtube.com/@BlippiEspanol) - dubbed show (originally made in US in English) that kids absolutely love
- [Mundo Zamba](https://www.youtube.com/@mundozamba) - Argentinian kids cartoon show
- [Pakapaka](https://www.youtube.com/user/CanalPakapaka) - think of this as the PBS of Argentina (content made for kids)
- [Spanish Immersion for Babies & Toddlers - with Liz](https://www.youtube.com/@SpanishwithLiz) - this is the Ms.Rachel equivalent in Spanish

If you have more to add to the list, feel free to email joe@speakargentinianspanish.com and I can add them for you!
