When you're thinking of expanding your vocabulary, one area you should pick is the industry you work in. For me, I work [professionally as a programmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsjoeio) so I chose to make a list of coding terms (with the help of my Argentinian friend who is also a programmer).

I decided to share this here so it'll help you learn these words too!

## Coding Terms

Here is a short list of words you should know:

- server - servidor
- front-end - frontend
- back-end - backend
- client - cliente (like a machine, host, pc)
- API - api
- request - consulta
- library - libreria
- NPM module - modulo npm
- function - función
- developer - desarrollador
- programmer - programador
- website - sitio web
- app - aplicación
- click - cliquear
- scroll - desplazar
- full-stack - full-stack
